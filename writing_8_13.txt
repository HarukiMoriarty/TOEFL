The reading passage puts foward the issue that Ceramic disks were used as tools in kichten, musical instruments and mirros.
However, this statement is questioned by the lecture which provides different evidences.

The professors begins to reveal that the disks could not be used in cooking by pointing out that pans and pots become blackened or 
discolored after having come into the high heat, however, the disks could not be found the same marks and preserved well. This evidence contradicts
with the viewpoint that Ceramic disks would have placed the food and cooked in fire, as stated in the reading passage.

Then the professor goes on to maintain that Ceramic disks could not served as musical instruments such as drums. She thinks that
the sound made by disks are different from drums and they were so heavy that could not easy to be used, wooden drums is much
easier and suitable for these functions. According to the passage however, the writer thinks that Ceramic disks could have stretech 
animal skins over the side and people could use them by holding it with one hand while struck the skin with the other hand. Therefore, 
the lecture goes against the reading passage.

Finally, the lecture disputes the theory that Ceramics disks were a kind of ancient mirrors. This example alse casts doubt on the 
professor view, which considers that when filling the disk with liquid, people have to place it horizontally with its decorated 
sidedown, making elaborate decoration entirely hidden from view. As for metal mirrors, everyone could see their decorations because
people held them vertically. Ancient people would not made elaborate decorations that no one could see it.
